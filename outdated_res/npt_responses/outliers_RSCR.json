However, there is a critical error in the rotation step: the rotation of (-3, 2) by 90\u00b0 clockwise should yield (2, 3), not (-2, -3). Because of this mistake, the final answer is incorrect. The student correctly describes the reflection step. The initial rotation rule is wrongly applied, leading to a wrong final answer."},"correctness":{"1545":0},"clarity":{"1545":4},"reasoning":{"1545":3},"notation":{"1545":4},"total":{"1545":"11"},"api_equiv":{"1545":false},"is_equiv":{"1545":false},"true_answer":{"1545":"(3,2)"},"z_correctness":{"1545":-2.9941544149},"z_clarity":{"1545":0.0287637443},"z_reasoning":{"1545":-0.8162009563},"z_notation":{"1545":-0.6441764691},"z_diff_rs_crr":{"1545":2.1779534586}}
